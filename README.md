A starter project to quickly beginning development with Sass, Pug, and pnpm. Using pnpm is necessary here, as it manages running script concurrently using its regex pattern selection support for scripts.

## Features

- Streamlined Sass to CSS compilation
- Compilation of nunjucks files to HTML
- Live-reloading to reflect CSS and HTML changes in real-time

## Dependencies used

I'm avoiding the use of additional packages like `npm-run-all`, aiming to maintain a setup limited to its core dependencies.

- [Browser-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync)
- [Pug CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-cli)
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)

This project utilizes only three development dependencies; you may add more of your choice, such as Autoprefixer, CSSnano, and others, and configure them accordingly.
